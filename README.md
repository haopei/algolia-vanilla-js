# An Algolia + Vanilla Javascript Setup
This is a demo of how to minimally set up Algolia to work with JavaScript

### How to run
1. Open index.html in browser.
2. Type a search query (try `joey`) into the search box.
3. Results are retrieved and presented in the template


# Notes
- A new search is performed on the `keyup` event on search bar
- A search query is run against an existing `contacts` index (hosted by Algolia).
